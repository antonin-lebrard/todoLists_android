<h3>Features</h3>

- Notes added and organized by Categories.
- Search in google directly each note.
- Text selectable to do other things than search into google (search in another search engine, share the note, ...).
- Delete note without complex move-set.
- A single username tied to each notes (no password, reasons explicited in "Help and Commentaries" part of the app).
- A cache system storing offline all the notes accessed within the app.

- Synchronise the changes made offline, when entering online mode.
